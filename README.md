## Progressive Web App (PWA)

The application is configured as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, transforming it into an installable, offline-capable application that works across all devices and platforms.

### What is a PWA?

A Progressive Web App combines the best of web and native apps. It runs in a browser but can be installed on your device like a native app, works offline, and provides a fast, app-like experience.

### PWA Features

#### Core Capabilities
- **📱 Installable**: Add to home screen on mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: Aggressive caching for instant page loads (pages load in <1 second after first visit)
- **🔌 Offline Access**: Study courses without internet connection after initial download
- **💾 Smart Caching**: Resources downloaded once and cached locally (saves bandwidth)
- **🚀 App-Like Experience**: Runs in full-screen standalone mode without browser UI
- **🔄 Auto-Updates**: Automatically updates when new content is available
- **📊 Reduced Data Usage**: Only downloads new/changed content

#### What Gets Cached?

When you use the PWA, these resources are automatically cached for offline access:
- ✅ All course pages (Course 0-10)
- ✅ Course data (JSON files with vocabulary)
- ✅ Audio files (pronunciation audio for all courses)
- ✅ Static assets (JavaScript, CSS, images)
- ✅ Navigation and UI components

### How It Works

#### 1. Service Worker
The PWA uses a **Service Worker** - a script that runs in the background and manages caching:
- Intercepts network requests
- Serves cached content when offline
- Updates cache when online
- Ensures fast loading times

#### 2. Caching Strategy
The app uses **Workbox** with intelligent caching strategies:
- **Cache First**: Static assets load from cache immediately
- **Network First**: Dynamic content tries network first, falls back to cache
- **Stale While Revalidate**: Shows cached content while updating in background

#### 3. Manifest File
The `manifest.json` file defines the app's:
- Name: "Japanese Learn"
- Theme colors: Blue (#2563eb)
- Icons: 192x192 and 512x512 SVG icons
- Display mode: Standalone (full-screen)
- Start URL: Home page

### Installation Guide

**Android (Chrome, Edge, Samsung Internet)**:
1. Open https://your-app-url.com in your browser
2. Tap the **menu icon** (⋮) in the top-right corner

2. **Install the app**: Follow installation steps above
3. **Browse content**: Visit all courses you want to use offline
4. **Audio caching**: Play audio files to cache them for offline use

#### Offline Usage

1. **Open the app**: Tap the home screen icon (mobile) or app icon (desktop)
2. **Browse offline**: Navigate through cached courses
3. **Play audio**: Listen to cached pronunciation audio
4. **Practice vocabulary**: Review flashcards and vocabulary
5. **Auto-sync**: When online, the app automatically updates with new content

#### Managing Storage
The PWA caches content locally. To check storage:

2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Storage** in left sidebar
4. View **Cache Storage** and **Service Workers**

**To clear cache**:

     - **Service Workers**: Verify worker is registered and active
     - **Manifest**: Check app configuration and icons
     - **Cache Storage**: View cached resources
   - **Lighthouse** tab:
     - Select "Progressive Web App" category
     - Run audit (should score 90+)
     - Review recommendations

3. **Test offline mode**:
   - Visit pages while online
   - Open DevTools > Network tab
   - Select "Offline" throttling
   - Refresh page - should work offline

#### For Users

1. **Installation test**:
   - Visit the app
   - Check for install prompt or icon
   - Install and verify home screen icon

2. **Offline test**:

### Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Installation | Offline | Service Worker | Score |
|---------|-------------|---------|----------------|-------|
| Chrome (Desktop) | ✅ Full | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Chrome (Android) | ✅ Full | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Edge (Desktop) | ✅ Full | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Safari (iOS) | ✅ Limited | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Safari (Mac) | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Firefox | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**Note**: All modern browsers support PWA core features (offline, caching). Installation prompts vary by browser.

### Troubleshooting

#### App not installing?
- **Check browser**: Use Chrome or Edge for best support
- **Visit twice**: Some browsers require 2+ visits before showing install
- **Check HTTPS**: PWAs require secure connection (HTTPS or localhost)
- **Clear cache**: Try clearing browser cache and revisiting

#### Offline mode not working?
- **Visit pages first**: Content must be cached by visiting while online
- **Check service worker**: Open DevTools > Application > Service Workers
- **Wait for cache**: Large audio files take time to cache
- **Reinstall**: Uninstall and reinstall the app

#### App not updating?
- **Close and reopen**: Service worker updates on app restart
- **Clear cache**: Force update by clearing cache
- **Check console**: Look for errors in browser console
